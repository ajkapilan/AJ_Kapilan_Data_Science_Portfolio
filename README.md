## About Me
Welcome to my Coding portfolio! I am a Third-Year Neuroscience Undergrad at Dalhousie University. All the works that have been shown to you today was made from my Data Science class. As a beginner coder/programmer I have learned alot of fun things about coding. Take a look at some of my works!

## Sample Works

I will showcase some of my work the best higlights my coding abilites!

- Data Visualization makes data look beautiful! [Check these plots out](Data_Visualization.md).  

- Working With Pandas...not the animals the [Dataframes](pandas_dataframe.md). :panda_face:

- This example shows information on [Single Unit Data and Data Visualization](Single_Unit_PSTH_Plots.md).

- Here is a quick visual summary of a great [Ted Talk on EEG Data and Machine Learning](EEG_Mach_TT.md).

- I used Scipy to identify and find different statistical values. [Heres how](One_Tailed_Ttest_EDA.md). 

- Using Python for [Neural Imaging Identification](Neural_Imaging.md).
